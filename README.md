# Dstny Workadventure map

To edit map,

1. Checkout this project 
2. Create a classic token with your name for the project (github user: DstnyWorkAdventure pwd: ask ad(e)min)
3. Download&install tiled on https://www.mapeditor.org/
4. Start tiled (on my laptop it is not stable if not run as root)
5. edit office3.json

There are several layers

![Layers][./layers.png]

Use the furniture layer to add to the furniture what you want.

Some tiles are included in the project. If you want to add new tileset, you will need to embed them. a tile which is not embedded will break the map

Then,
git add office3.json
git commit "my new commit"
git push
user: DstntWorkAdventure
password: your classic token
